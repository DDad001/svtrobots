# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions for running the app

You can take a look at the project by cloning the repo or downloading the zip file:

Once you have opened up the project in visual studio code, follow the steps below:

### `Open up terminal and install node modules`

Type this in the terminal: npm install 

### `Then run npm start`

Type this in the terminal: npm start

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## (BONUS) What I would do next

### `Add a search by battery level field`

This feature would allow you to populate all the robots by typing in their battery level value.

EX: If a user would type in 99 then all the robots that have the battery value of 99 would be displayed 
on the screen.

The way I would implement this would be to add an input field with an onChange and store the value of the input
field in a variable. Then I would would simply just run a filter on the data retrieved from the robot API and 
display the robots that correspond with the users input value.
